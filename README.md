# HTML-Challenge
## Purpose
The purpose of this challenge was to grab most recent news on Mars as well as some facts on Mars and images of Hemispheres. I have successfully grabbed these information using HTML codes.

## Challenges
I had some challenges on changing the format of the mars facts table. For example, in our HTML code, we have the following codes with row being as class instead of table. Also, I was not able to get "Mars Title" and "Mars Paragraph" for "Latest Mars News" section by clicking the run button on VS Code until I was told to type "python app.py". I was able to click the button and get these information by running that.

<!-- Section for Mars Hemispheres -->
      <div class="row" id="mars-hemispheres">
        <div class="page-header">
          <h2 class="text-center">Mars Hemispheres</h2>
        </div>

## Changes on index.html
I have made two changes to the page. 1)Changed the "Scrape New Data" to italic and changed the blue color to green 2) reorganized the images of hemispheres to four in a row instead of the old version 2 in one row. It looks more clean and precise now. Overall, this was one of the biggest challenges so far.
